# Equity in Healthcare Analysis Using Metastatic Cancer Data

Healthcare disparities remain a significant challenge, affecting how patients access timely diagnosis and treatment. This project examines potential inequities in the diagnosis timeline for metastatic cancer, with a focus on how demographic factors may influence the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis within 90 days of screening.

By leveraging a specialized oncology dataset and applying machine learning techniques, the analysis seeks to uncover patterns, biases, and relationships that may contribute to unequal healthcare outcomes. The findings aim to provide actionable insights into the role of patient demographics in diagnostic delays, identify areas of healthcare inequity, and support strategies for improving fairness and accessibility in cancer care.
